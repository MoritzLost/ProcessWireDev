# What are your quality standards?

Since I want to talk about best practices, it's important to define what the actual goals for the sites I write about are. All of us have different processes and care about different aspects of our websites. This page serves as a manifest for my own quality standards against which I measure the success of a project. I invite you to read through the list and think about which aspects are more or less important to you, and what other things would go on your list. If there is a large disconnect between your values and mine, some of the chapters might feel unnecessary or counterproductive - which is totally fine. You should carefully consider what's important to you and disregard any advice I give if it clashes with your goals for your development work or individual projects.
