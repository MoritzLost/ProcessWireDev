# The complete (opinionated) guide to adept ProcessWire development

Welcome to this guide - I'm glad you could make it. As the title says, this is a comprehensive guide to developing websites with the [ProcessWire Content-Management-Framework](https://processwire.com/). This guide aims to illustrate best practices for web development in terms of performance, accessibility, security, extensibility, developer and user experience in the context of ProcessWire.

## This guide is not a starter tutorial

I do not want to write the millionth `hello world` tutorial that will teach you how to install the CMS and setup your first field. If you're looking for a ProcessWire starter tutorial, take a look at [ProcessWire CMS - A Beginner's Guide by Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/the-aesthetic-of-non-opinionated-content-management-a-beginners-guide-to-processwire/). Instead, This guide assumes some level of familiarity with ProcessWire and PHP, as well as a solid grasp on current web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript / ES6 and above). The reason for that is because I want to talk about high-level concepts without reiterating the basics in every step.

That said, I want this resource to be as inclusive as possible, so I'll try to write as inclusively as possible and avoid overcomplicating things unnecessarily.

If you need some general pointers on ProcessWire, I consider the following topics from the ProcessWire documentation to be essential reading:

- [Using template files in ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/docs/start/templates/) and [How to structure your template files](https://processwire.com/docs/tutorials/how-to-structure-your-template-files/), especially the section on _Delayed Output_.
- [About the ProcessWire API](https://processwire.com/docs/start/api/) and [Introduction to ProcessWire API variables](https://processwire.com/docs/start/variables/)
- [Using selectors](https://processwire.com/docs/selectors/)
- [Multiple language support with ProcessWire](https://processwire.com/docs/multi-language-support/)
- **[ProcessWire API Reference](https://processwire.com/api/ref/)** - You should always have a tab with this page opened ;)

## Definitions and roles

This guide includes chapters on how to make life a little easier for everyone involved in the lifecycle of building and maintaining a site. For clarity, here are the different roles and people that may have a stake in your projects.

- **Developers** - That's probably you, as well as everyone else who has access to the site's source code and / or superadmin access to the CMS. You may take some shortcuts when you are the only developer for a project. But even then, you should always work under the assumption that a different person has to read and understand your code â€“ just in case you have to go back to change something after six months.
- **Clients** and **Editors** - Your client is the person you're building the site for. There is always a client; if you are working on an internal project for your company, the client is your boss. If you're working on a project of your own, you are your own client! Everyone who uses the CMS to edit pages and content is an editor. Usually, clients and editors are the same people, or at least work in the same organization.
- **Users** or **Visitors** - The people who will actually visit your site once it's finished. There's no clear distinction between users and visitors, it mostly depends on whether the site is more of a brochure site conveying information, or an application that the users interact with. User experience (UX) is important for both, so for all intents and purposes, we don't need to differentiate between the two.
